The test is run by catting the trainging data file for the iris with
the test data file with 54 tests to see how well the NN has learned.
The first 24 tests are stress tests the remaining 30 are 10 from 
each class of training data.

The test command:

cat iris.dat iristest.dat | nn

In the test set on line there can be a few disagreements but
between the expected results in test.out and what you generate
but there should not be massive disagreement.
